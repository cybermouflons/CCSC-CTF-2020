The last rose of Cintra
Has blood upon her thorns
A forgotten tale of Elder Blood
And all futures past reborn
Swirling spheres of otherness
Of hope and doom forlorn
Her path could lead to happiness
Or the end of times for all
Ghosts of futures falling
Have saddled up to ride
Seeking the Lion Cub of Cintra
Last living of her pride
And every hand will reach for
The power that lies untold
The time of ax and sword is nigh
Blood-red seeds of war are sown
So seek ye now the White Wolf
Heâ€™ll stay their wicked hand
A steel and silver burning heart
To guide through darkened lands
Your future lies unspoken
In timeless emerald eyes
A world may burn as pages turn
Or a savior may arise!
The flag is
