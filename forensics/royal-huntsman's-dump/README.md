The memory dump contains a cmd process which runs a powershell command that can be extracted with volatility.
```powershell
volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ..\..\Desktop\medump\medump.raw imageinfo
volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ..\..\Desktop\medump\medump.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 pslist
volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ..\..\Desktop\medump\medump.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 memdump -D dump/ -p 180
volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ..\..\Desktop\medump\medump.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 memdump -D dump/ -p 1128
```

```bash
strings -e l ./108.dmp | grep wget # Gets the file for the flag
strings -e l ./1128.dmp | grep rundll32 # Founds the name of the file "update.dll"
