This is the official repository with the challenges published in CCSC CTF 2020. Each challenge has a `public` and `setup` folder and is accompanied with a short description. The `setup` folder contains all the files required to build and host the challenge and usually contains the flag and a proof of concept solution as well. Alternatively, the `public` folder contains the files that are released to the participant during the competition.
