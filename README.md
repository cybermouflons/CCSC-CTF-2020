## Repository Structure

This is the official repository with the challenges published in CCSC CTF 2020. Each challenge has a `public` and `setup` folder (if applicable) and is accompanied with a short description. The `setup` folder contains all the files required to build and host the challenge and usually contains the flag and a proof of concept solution as well. Alternatively, the `public` folder contains the files that are released to the participant during the competition.

## Dependencies

Although some of the challenges may run as is, it is recommended that you have **docker** and **docker-compose** installed and use the provided scripts to run the challenges to ensure isolation and therefore proper environment setup.
